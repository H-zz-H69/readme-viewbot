# GitHub View Botting Script

This Python script is designed to artificially increase the number of profile views on GitHub. It uses HTTP requests to repeatedly open a specific GitHub profile page and scrape the view count. The script can be run for extended periods without hitting rate limits, making it a simple solution to boost views over time.

## Features

- **No rate limit issues**: The script can run for days and weeks and months without hitting rate limits.
- **Efficient view count scraping**: Checks for view count periodically and logs progress.
- **Low impact**: Not currently detectable as a bot (I dont think github really cares tho?).

## Disclaimer

- This script is for **educational purposes only**. Use it responsibly, and ensure you're not violating any platform terms of service.
- This bot does not guarantee results, and usage could potentially lead to restrictions or bans if used inappropriately.
- This bot is not guaranteed to work indefinitely or across all use cases—GitHub's policies and detection mechanisms could change.

## How to Use
1.
   ```bash
   python viewbot.py
   ```
   
2. The script will run continuously, sending requests to the target GitHub page to increment the view count. Check the terminal output to see the progress.

## Notes

- This script is designed for long-term usage with random intervals between requests.
- It's **not the fastest** method available but works reliably over time.
- The script should **not** trigger rate limits in its current state, but please monitor it and adjust the rate if necessary.
